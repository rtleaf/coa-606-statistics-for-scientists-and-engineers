Course Meeting Time,4:00 to 5:15 PM,
Office Hours,"I have an open door policy and welcome your questions and concerns. Stop in to see me anytime or make an appointment and lets meet to discuss your needs. Unfortunately, sometimes I have deadlines and travel and will not be able to accommodate ""drop in"" students every time but will make every reasonable effort to accomodate your schedule.",
Course Workload Statement,"The expectation of the University of Southern Mississippi is that students should spend approximately 2 to 3 hours outside of class each week for every hour in class working on reading, assignments, studying, and other work for the course. Time management is thus critical for student success. All students should assess their personal circumstances and talk with their advisors about the appropriate number of credit hours to take each term. Resources for academic support can be found at https://www.usm.edu/success. ",
Academic Support Resources,"If a student knows or believes that they have a disability which is covered by the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and makes them eligible to receive classroom accommodations, they should contact the Office for Disability Accommodations (ODA) for information regarding the registration process. Disabilities covered by the ADA may include but are not limited to ADHD, learning disabilities, psychiatric disabilities, physical disabilities, chronic health disorders, temporary illnesses or injuries and pregnancies. Students should contact ODA if they are not certain whether their documented medical condition qualifies for ODA services. Students are only required to disclose their disability to the Office for Disability Accommodations. All information submitted to ODA by the student is held with strict confidentiality.",
Mental Well-Being Statement,"I recognize that students sometimes experience challenges that make learning difficult. If you find that life stressors such as anxiety, depression, relationship problems, difficulty concentrating, alcohol or drug problems, or other stressful experiences are interfering with your academic or personal success, consider contacting Student Counseling Services on campus at 601-266-4829. More information is also available at https://www.usm.edu/student-counseling- services. All students are eligible for free, confidential individual or group counseling services. In the event of emergency, please call 911 or contact the counselor on call at 601-606-HELP (4357).",
Nondiscrimination Statement,"The University of Southern Mississippi offers to all persons equal access to educational, programmatic and employment opportunities without regard to age, sex, sexual orientation, disability, pregnancy, gender identity, genetic information, religion, race, color, national origin, and/or veteran status pursuant to applicable state and federal law.",
Confidentiality and Mandatory Reporting,"As an instructor, one of my responsibilities is to help create and maintain a safe learning environment. I have a mandatory reporting responsibility related to my role as a faculty member. I am required to share information regarding sexual misconduct or information about a crime that may have occurred on the USM campus with certain University officials responsible for the investigation and remediation of sexual misconduct. The information will remain private and will only be shared with those officials necessary to resolve the matter. If you would like to speak in confidence, resources available to students include Confidential Advisors with the Shafer Center for Crisis Intervention, the Counseling Center, and Student Health Services. More information on these resources and University Policies is available at https://www.usm.edu/sexual-misconduct.",
Course Scheduling,,
Academic Integrity,"All students at the University of Southern Mississippi are expected to demonstrate the highest levels of academic integrity. Forms of academic dishonesty include cheating (including copying from others work), plagiarism (representing another persons words or ideas as your own; failure to properly cite the source of your information, argument, or concepts), falsification of documents, disclosure of or use of test material or other assignment content to another student, submission of the same paper or other assignment to more than one class without the explicit approval of all faculty members involved, unauthorized academic collaboration with others, conspiracy to engage in academic misconduct.",
Academic Integrity 2,"Engaging in any of these behaviors or supporting others who do so will result in academic penalties and/or other sanctions. If a faculty member determines that a student has violated our Academic Integrity Policy, sanctions ranging from resubmission of work to course failure may occur, including the possibility of receiving a grade of XF for the course, which will be on the student transcript with the notation ""Failure due to academic misconduct.""",
